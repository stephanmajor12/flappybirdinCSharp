A simple login/game to play.

Hey this is my simple app that allows a user to login to a database. And have the database record there score in a game.

You need to have Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
You also need to run the provided sql for this to work.

Template username/password is just admin/admin.
Enjoy!
